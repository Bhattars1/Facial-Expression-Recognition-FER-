This project developed a deep learning model for facial expression recognition using the 'TinyVGG' architecture, trained on the 'AffectNet' dataset with around 29,000 images. Despite achieving over 39% accuracy during training, the model's performance dropped to 10.53% when tested on a different dataset, highlighting generalization issues. A Flask web application was created for practical use, allowing users to upload images for classification. Future improvements will focus on refining the model and increasing dataset diversity. The project has applications in human-computer interaction, healthcare, security, marketing, and education. The code is available on GitHub for further development.
